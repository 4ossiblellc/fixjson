## What is JSON?
JSON or JavaScript Object Notation is a language-independent open data format that uses human-readable text to express data objects consisting of attribute-value pairs.

Although originally derived from the JavaScript scripting language, JSON data can be generated and parsed with a wide variety of programming languages including JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby and Java.

## Why we use JSON?
Since the JSON format is text only, it can easily be sent to and from a server, and used as a data format by any programming language.

JavaScript has a built in function to convert a string, written in JSON format, into native JavaScript objects:

JSON.parse()
So, if you receive data from a server, in JSON format, you can use it like any other JavaScript object.

## The JSON standard
JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax:

Data is in name/value pairs
Data is separated by commas
Curly braces hold objects
Square brackets hold arrays
