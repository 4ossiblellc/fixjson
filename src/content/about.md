One day, Terri and I, Eric, needed to investigate an issue by using the JSON object from server logs. Those JSON object from log are missing some double quotes in the property keys. We have been searching online tools to refactor the JSON so that we can debug using our code. However, we could not find any solution online. And that's why we come up with this online tool and hope to help other developers.
